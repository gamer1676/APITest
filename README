APITest

APITest was developed in IntelliJ Community Version 2020.3.3.

APITest is a simple Automation framework that automates 2 API from http://deckofcardsapi.com/.  The
framework is broken down into 3 components:  common, code, and tests.  In the common folder, you will
find a very simple API Client that implements the GET and POST method.  Also in the common folder, you
will find a WebService class that extends the simple API Client to show case OOP inheritance.

In the model folder, you will find classes that model the response calls for the APIs.  Since we are
only calling 2 APIs, I only modeled 3 objects: New Deck Response, Draw Card Response, and the Cards model.
We use Gson to serialize the API responses into their respected Model.

In the test folder, you will find one test case for each API.  To run the test, please load it through
IntellI by selecting New Project, and selecting the folder that contains the APITest.iml file.  Once
the project is loaded, you can expand to APITest/src/test/java location.  You can right click on the
"DeckOfCardUnitTest" class and select "Run 'DeckOfCardUnitTest'" from the sub menu to run the tests.
